        I&apos;m a Frontend Engineer with over 3 years of industry experience! I
        fell in love with Frontend back in September 2020 when I began my
        Bachelor&apos;s degree because of an HTML/CSS class that got me hooked.
        I started focusing on Next.js and have been using it professionally and
        for all of my side projects. Other than Web technologies, I&apos;m also
        enthusiastic about UI/UX design and have enrolled in a Master&apos;s
        degree in Design and Multimedia. AI has also been a topic I took
        interest in, so in my free time I work on side projects experimenting
        with it.
